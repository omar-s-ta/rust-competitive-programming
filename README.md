# Rusty Algorithmic Adventures

This is a `Rust` mirror of the `C++` repo [competitive-programming](https://github.com/omar-s-ta/competitive-programming),

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`algo_lib/`**: Implementations of core and advanced data structures
  and algorithms. These are reusable building blocks refined throughout
  years of solving problems.

- **`tasks/`**: Solutions from various online judges, competitions,
  and solutions progress of [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/)

---

The repo uses [rust-competitive-helper](https://github.com/rust-competitive-helper/rust-competitive-helper/tree/main).
Some online judges like `UVA` still does not support Rust.
