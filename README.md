# Competitive Programming Repository

This is a `Rust` mirror of the `C++`` repo [competitive-programming](https://github.com/omar-s-ta/competitive-programming),

The repo uses [rust-competitive-helper](https://github.com/rust-competitive-helper/rust-competitive-helper/tree/main).
Some online judges like `UVA` still does not support Rust.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`algo_lib/`**: Contains implementations of advanced data structures and
  algorithms in Rust.

- **`tasks/`**: Includes solutions from various online judges and
  [Competitive Programming 4 Book](https://cpbook.net/) problems solutions.
